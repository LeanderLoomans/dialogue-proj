This script converts .wav-files into spectrograms that are loaded & saved as three DataLoader-objects.

Usage:

Before running, review the exact file structure below:

mainfolder/
    SIGMA.ipynb
    audio/
        wavfiles/
            /#place your .wav file(s) here
    images_nosplit/
        /spectrograms
            #this is where the converted spectrograms will be stored
    images_splitfolders/
        test/
            spectrograms/
                #this is where the spectrograms used for testing will be stored
        train/
            spectrograms/
                #this is where the spectrograms used for training will be stored
        val/
            spectrograms/
                #this is where the spectrograms used for validating will be stored
        
Only the 'audio'-folder and 'wavfiles'-subfolder need to be created. The program will (should) create all the other folders & files
The dataloader objects will be created in the root folder (same as the .ipynb)
